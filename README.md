# Tutorial of using CNN of Python Keras module

Wei-Ying Wang

This is my tutorial about how to use Keras to construct a CNN model for digit recognition. The tutorial tried to be comprehensive about building CNN with Keras. Keras is designed to be easy to use and manipulate, however I found difficult to understand the structure I built when I first used it. I hope this tutorial can help smooth the learning curve of using Keras.
